Defense your python project/separated file by hiding it using encryption

❕ This tool will be useful if you want to share your Python project/separated file without revealing its source code. All contents of the files are encrypted and cannot be read by a person, while this does not affect the functionality and the output of the code.

--------------------------------------------

🛠 *Usage*:

```
cd ../SourceCodeDefencer

> python run_defencer.py

> Please, enter path to project folder -> ./path_target_project
```
OR

```
> cd ../SourceCodeDefencer

> python run_defencer.py ./path_target_project
```

--------------------------------------------

ℹ️ℹ️ℹ️ Additional info

🐍 The encryption is only proceeded with .py extension files

🖨 The tool creates copy of target folder in order to keep the original code

📂 Folder "Project_Sample" does not consist of any usable files. It's just for example purpose
